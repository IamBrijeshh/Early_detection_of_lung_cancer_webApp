    <h1>Project Name: Early Detection of Lung Cancer Using DataScience Techniques</h1>
    <h2>Type of Application:</h2>
        Web Application
    <h2>Project Description:</h2>
        The healthcare sector is heavily reliant on data science.Recent technological
        advances and developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods
        have the potential to transform global health, particularly for the early detection and diagnosis.
        Early detection and diagnosis stand alone in terms of dramatic life-saving potential unlocked 
        through incremental advances. Let us consider cancer survival as an example. Cancer Research 
        UK says over 90 percent of stage 1 bowel cancer patients will survive for five or more years. On 
        the other hand, this figure drops to 10 percent for stage 4 patients. The same trend holds true for 
        all other prevalent cancer types. Despite impressive progress in increasing cancer survival rates in 
        recent decades, late-stage diagnosis rates have remained stubbornly high. To decrease death rates, 
        machine learning algorithms can be used. Based on the symptoms, it will predict the likelihood 
        that a disease will develop.
